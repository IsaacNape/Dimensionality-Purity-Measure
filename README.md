# Dimensionality-Purity-Measure
Collection of  (MatLab) codes for optimally determining the dimensions and purity of a high dimensional quantum entangled state.
These are supporting functions for determining purity and dimensionality based on maximum likelyhood optimization. This assumes that the function modelling the system is an isotropic Wegner state and that its pure part follows some known distribution.
